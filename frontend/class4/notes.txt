positions-absolute=it will find the nearest relative parent and take it as origin, if nothing is found then browser top left is considered

absolute slows down the loading process. so keep them very less. these will be individually rendered

z-index is always used with absolute

position absolute creates a new layer.

footer is at lower or same priority of content

viewport is area of webpage on screen

we cannot give any property to static

margin: 10px 20px 30px 10px(top, right, bottom, left)
margin: 10px 20px(top-bottom, right-left)

margin in % is dependent on parent's width
eg- if parent is 2000px then 20% then 400px is margin

display: inline, block, inline-block, none;
width and height does not exist in inline elements
span will take the size of its content
div will take the whole width of its container

width will not affect inline elements

inline-block was introduced to add width to inline elements

<span></span> /*then inline-block**/ <div>
this will also give nav type layout but we have to give the margin
